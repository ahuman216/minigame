What your project is/does (and what it's called)
My project is called minigame and it is a little website for anyone to play some simple games when they are bored. it is supposed to be cute and fun just to spend some time when you're bored.
Why you made your project
I made this project because i enjoy playing games and having a simple interface that isn't cluttered with ads and other distractions is nice to take a break and not get too distracted.
How you made your project
I originally made this project using python programs, but because i wanted to challenge myself further i tried to turn it into a website using html and flask, so i rewrote all the python files into classes that could be acessed and used by flask, and i made an html document for the ui itself. 
What you struggled with and what you learned
I struggled with learning flask and html because i do not have much experience with either, but i learned a lot about both of them and feel pretty comfortable using them now!
